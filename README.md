# Rasselbande
The Rassbelbande ("Rascals", german) is a collective of four students at Ersamus University Rotterdam. During their participation in a Data Science Course offered by the amazings Samaritans at Turing Society Rotterdam, the four germans gathered. In unity they took on the challenge of solving the pressing issues of our generation, in this case: Does spending on movie budget have a significant effect on said movies revenues?

## Project Goal
The project aims to clean, present and anaylse data regarding the stated topic, using Python. A significant Least Square Regression was built to simplify analysis of the relationship between Budget and Revenue.

## Findings
The Regression shows, that a substantial part of Revenues is caused by Budgets. Additionally it was found, that an increase of budget by 1$ is followed by 2.75$ more Revenue on average.

  ### Limitations
  Total Budget includes Marketing cost. A cheap movie marketed expensively can yield higher revenues than vice versa. A focus on productuon spending solely should yield more accurate rersults.

  ### Suggestions for further Research
  Finding a larger dataset of movies and performing a regression with dummy variables for all genres. It is reasonable to assume different financial      behavior in different movie categories. Also a venture into streaming numbers, if ever realiably retrievable, would be interesting.
